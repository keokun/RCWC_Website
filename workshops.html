      <div class="title">November 15th</div>
      <div class="descr">Everyone sat in a circle and each started writing a story. After several minutes, the stories were passed to the next person, who continued the story. The time each person had to write decreased each time they were passed until everyone had their original papers back. The stories were then read aloud to the group.</a></div>

      <div class="title">October 11th</div>
      <div class="descr">Everyone was given a different stock photo of a person. In ten minutes, each person created a character based off the stock image, defining personality, career, motivations, family, lifestyle, etc. Afterwards, everyone was separated into groups of three or four people. Each group was given three words at random. The goal was to combine each group member's character and each of the three words into a cohesive story plot.</a></div>
